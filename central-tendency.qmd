## Measures of Central Tendency

> Describe the center or typical value of a dataset. 

<br>

. . .

The three most common measures are:

1. Mean (Average).

1. Median (Middle value).

1. Mode (Most frequent value).

## Mean

> The mean is calculated as the sum of all data points divided by the number of points. It’s sensitive to extreme values (outliers).

<br>

. . .

$$
\bar{X} = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^nx_i}{\displaystyle n}
$$

## Median

> The median is the middle value of a sorted dataset. It is robust to outliers.

. . .

> If the dataset has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.

## Mode

> The mode is the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. 

## Problems with Mode

> Unlike the mean and median, there can be no mode, one mode, or multiple modes.

## Key Insights

- **Mean:** Best for symmetric datasets but affected by outliers.

- **Median:** Robust to outliers, useful for skewed data.

- **Mode:** Describes the most common value, useful for categorical data.
