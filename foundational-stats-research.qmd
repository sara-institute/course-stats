## Population

-   The population is the **complete set** of all individuals, items, or observations that share a common characteristic and are of interest to the researcher.

-   It represents everyone or everything you want to **draw conclusions** about.

-   The population has fixed **parameters** like the true mean (μ) or standard deviation (σ), though these are often unknown and what we're trying to **estimate**.

## Population Examples

-   All **registered voters** in a country (if studying voting behavior)
-   Every **student enrolled** in a university (if studying student satisfaction)
-   All **hospitals** in a region (if studying healthcare quality)
-   The **entire production** line output for a year (if studying defect rates)

## Sample

-   A sample is a **subset of the population** that's actually observed or measured in the study.

-   Since studying entire populations is often impractical, expensive, or impossible, researchers select a **representative** group to study instead.

-   Samples have **statistics** like the sample mean (x̄) or sample standard deviation (s), which are **used to estimate** the population parameters.

## Population vs Sample

| Population | Sample |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| All registered voters in a country | 1,500 randomly selected registered voters |
| Every student enrolled in a university | 300 students chosen from different departments |
| All hospitals in a region | 50 hospitals selected using stratified sampling |
| The entire production line output for a year | 500 randomly selected products from the production line |

## Statistical Inference

-   The goal of most research is **statistical inference**: using **sample statistics** to make educated guesses about **population parameters**.

-   The **quality of your sample** determines how well you can **generalize** findings back to the **population**.

## Hypothesis

-   A hypothesis is a **testable** statement or prediction about the relationship between variables in a population.

-   It's essentially an **educated guess** based on theory, prior research, or observation that you're trying to verify or refute using data from your sample.

## [How Hypothesis Connects to Population and Sample]{.r-fit-text}

-   **Hypothesis is about the population:** Your hypothesis makes a claim about the entire population (all students, all patients, etc.), even though you can't study everyone.

-   **Sample provides the evidence:** You collect data from your sample to test whether the evidence supports or contradicts the null hypothesis.

-   **Statistical inference bridges the gap:** You use statistical tests to determine whether the patterns you observe in your sample are strong enough to conclude something about the population.

## Variables

"Elements in the study that are measured or manipulated."

-   Independent variable

-   Dependent variable

## Statistical Learning

“Statistical Learning refers to a vast set of tools for understanding data.”

### Descriptive Statistics  

- Summarizes and organizes data to describe its main features. 
- Limited to the observed data. 
 
### Inferential Statistics 

- Makes predictions or inferences about a population from a sample.    
- Goes beyond the observed data to infer population characteristics.

## Sampling Variation

These statistics vary from one sample to the next.

## Sampling Error

These statistics sometimes differ from the population parameter.

$$

. . .

$$

Answer: 9

## Let's Understand this

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n x_i
$$

## Let's Understand this

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\ = 10 + 6 \\ = 16
$$

## Let's Try this

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n x^2_i
$$

## Let's Try this

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n x^2_i \\ = 10^2 + 6^2 \\ = 100 + 36 \\ = 136
$$

## Let's Try this

$$
\left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right )^2 
$$

## Let's Try this

$$
\left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right )^2 \\ = (10+6)^2 \\ = 16^2 \\ = 256
$$

## Scales of measurement

- Scales of measurement (also called levels of measurement) **classify** how variables are measured and what mathematical operations can be performed on them. 

- There are four main scales:
  - Nominal scale.
  - Ordinal scale.
  - Interval scale.
  - Ratio scale.
  
##  Nominal Scale

- Categories with no inherent order or ranking. 

- Categories are different but not better/worse or higher/lower

- Examples:

  - Gender (male, female, non-binary)
  - Blood type (A, B, AB, O)
  - Marital status (single, married, divorced, widowed)
  - Eye color (blue, brown, green, hazel)
  - Type of car (sedan, SUV, truck) 
  
## Ordinal Scale

- Categories with a meaningful order or ranking, but the intervals between ranks are not equal or known.

- You can rank items from lowest to highest

- Examples:
  - Education level (high school, bachelor's, master's, doctorate)
  - Satisfaction ratings (very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied)
  - Socioeconomic status (lower class, middle class, upper class)
  - Military ranks (private, corporal, sergeant, lieutenant)
  - Pain scale (mild, moderate, severe)

## Interval Scale

- Ordered categories with equal intervals between values, but no true zero point.

- Equal distances between consecutive values

- Examples:

  - Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit (0° doesn't mean "no temperature")
  - IQ scores (an IQ of 0 doesn't mean "no intelligence")
  - Standardized test scores (SAT, GRE)

## Ratio Scale

- Ordered categories with equal intervals AND a true/absolute zero point, where zero means complete absence of the quantity.

- Examples:

  - Height (0 cm = no height)
  - Weight (0 kg = no weight)
  - Age (0 years = just born)
  - Income (0 dollars = no money)
  - Number of children (0 = no children)
