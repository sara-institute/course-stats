## Z-score

- Z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.

- Purpose: To understand relative position within a distribution.

## Z-score Calculation

$$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

- $z$ = standardized score

- $x$ = data point

- $\mu$ = mean value

- $\sigma$ = standard deviation

- If the z-score is positive, the data point is above the mean; if negative, itâ€™s below the mean.

## Practice Z-score {background-color="skyblue"}

Z-scores provide a standardized method to:

- Compare data points across distributions.
    
- Detect outliers.
    
- Assess relative performance.

## Probability

- Probability is a way to talk about how likely something is to happen.

- It's like making a guess, but with some rules and numbers to help us know how good our guess is.

## Measure Probability

> Probability is a number between 0 and 1

- 0 means it will not happen (impossible).

- 1 means it will definitely happen (certain).

- In-between numbers mean "maybe."

## Probability Interpretation

- A probability between $0.5$ to $1$ means that an event is more **likely** to happen than not, and the closer to $1$ it gets, the more likely it is to happen.

- A probability between $0$ and $0.5$ means that an event is more **unlikely** to happen than to happen, and the closer to $0$ it gets, the less likely it is to happen.

## Probability Density Function

The area under the curve represents probability which is equal to $1$ or the probability of all scores summed together is $1$.

## Standard Normal Distribution 

![](images/normal-distribution-standard.png){fig-align=center}

## 68% of the Data

- Lies within 1 standard deviation ($\sigma$) from the mean ($\mu$).

- Between $\mu \pm 1\sigma$: Contains 68% of the total area under the curve.

## 95% of the Data

- Lies within 2 standard deviation ($\sigma$) from the mean ($\mu$).

- Between $\mu \pm 2\sigma$: Contains 95% of the total area under the curve.

![](images/normal-distribution-standard.png){fig-align=center}

## 99.7% of the Data

- Lies within 3 standard deviation ($\sigma$) from the mean ($\mu$).

- Between $\mu \pm 3\sigma$: Contains 99.7% of the total area under the curve.

## Example in Real-Life

**Height of Adults:**

- Assume adult heights follow a normal distribution:
        Mean ($\mu$) = 170 cm
        Standard deviation ($\sigma$) = 10 cm

Using the 68-95-99.7 rule:

- **68%** of adults are between 160 and 180 cm.

- **95%** of adults are between 150 and 190 cm.
    
- **99.7%** of adults are between 140 and 200 cm.
