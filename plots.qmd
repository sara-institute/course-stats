## Presenting Data

> Graphs are visual representations of data that help in understanding relationships, trends, and distributions.

## How to Choose the Right Graph

| Purpose                          | Best Graph                       |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Compare categories               | Bar chart, Pie Chart             |
| Show distribution                | Histogram, Box plot, Violin plot |
| Show trends over time            | Line graph, Area chart           |
| Show relationships/correlations  | Scatter plot, Bubble chart       |
| Visualize patterns in data       | Heatmap                          |

## Bar Chart

![](images/bargraph.png){fig-align="center"}

## Bar Chart

- Purpose: Compare quantities of categorical data.
    
- When to Use:
  - Show comparisons between categories (e.g., sales by region, population by country).
  - Highlight differences in frequency or proportion.
  
## Practice Bar Chart {background-color="skyblue"}

- Unordered Bar Chart: Use for simple category visualization.
    
- Ordered Bar Chart: Highlights the most/least common categories.
    
- Horizontal Bar Chart: Improves readability for long category names.
    
- Grouped Bar Chart: Compares subcategories across main categories.
    
- Stacked Bar Chart: Shows composition of each category.

## Histogram

## Histogram

![](images/bargraph.png){fig-align="center"}

## Histogram

- Purpose: Display the distribution of numerical data.

- When to Use:
    - Visualize frequency distribution (e.g., income levels, test scores).
    - Identify skewness, spread, and modes in data. 

## Histogram Key Points

- Bins: The range of values divided into intervals. The width of these intervals determines the bin size.

- Axis:
  - X-axis: The variable of interest (e.g., numerical values).
  - Y-axis: The frequency (count) or density of observations.    

## Practice Histograms {background-color="skyblue"}

- Basic Histogram: General overview of distribution.

- Custom Bin Width:	Fine-tuning for specific data patterns.

- Density Overlaid:	Assess distribution shape visually.

- Grouped Histogram: Compare distributions across subgroups.

- Faceted Histogram: Side-by-side comparison of subgroups.

- Cumulative Histogram:	Understand cumulative trends in the data.

## Line Graph

![](images/linegraph.png){fig-align="center"}

## Line Graph

- Purpose: Show trends over time or sequences.
    
- When to Use:
    - Analyze patterns over intervals (e.g., stock prices, temperature changes).
    - Compare multiple trends by plotting multiple lines.

## Practice Line Graphs {background-color="skyblue"}

- Basic Line Graph: Single line showing trends for one variable.

- Multiple Line Graphs: Comparing trends of multiple variables.

- Smoothed Line Graph: Adds a smooth curve to depict trends better.

- Line Graph with Points: Shows data points explicitly.

- Faceted Line Graph: Separate panels for different groups or variables.

- Step Line Graph: Shows data changes stepwise.

## Scatter Plot

![](images/scatterplot.png){fig-align="center"}

## Scatter Plot

- Purpose: Show relationships or correlations between two numerical variables.

- Scatter plots are commonly used to:
    - Observe correlations or relationships between variables.
    - Detect patterns, trends, or clusters.
    - Identify potential outliers.

## Key Points Scatter Points

- X-axis: Represents one variable (independent or predictor).

- Y-axis: Represents another variable (dependent or outcome).
    
- Points: Each point represents one observation.

## Practice Scatter Plots {background-color="skyblue"}

- Basic Scatter Plot:	Visualize relationships between two continuous variables.
- With Groups:	Compare relationships across categories or groups.
- With Regression Line:	Observe trends and linear relationships.
- With Size Aesthetic:	Add a third dimension to the plot (e.g., size of points).
- Faceted Scatter Plot:	Separate the data into different groups or panels.
- With Transparency:	Handle overplotting when data points overlap.

## Pie Chart

![](images/piechart.png){fig-align="center"}

## Pie Chart

- Purpose: Represent proportions of a whole.
    
- When to Use:
    - Show parts of a total (e.g., market share, budget allocation).
    - Use with few categories to avoid clutter. 

- Limitations:

  - Hard to interpret with many categories.
  - Poor for precise comparisons; consider bar charts for clarity.    

## Practice Pie Charts {background-color="skyblue"}

- Basic Pie Chart	Represent proportions of categories in a single dataset.

- With Percentages	Display proportions explicitly for easier interpretation.

- Donut Chart	Aesthetic variation of a pie chart, often used in dashboards.

- Faceted Pie Chart	Compare distributions across multiple groups.

- Exploded Pie Chart	Highlight a specific slice for emphasis.

## Box Plot (or Box-and-Whisker Plot)

![](images/boxplot.png){fig-align="center"}
## Box Plot

- Purpose: Summarize the distribution of data through quartiles.

- When to Use:

  - Identify spread, outliers, and medians (e.g., comparing test scores across groups).
  - Compare distributions across categories.
  
## Box Plot

![](images/boxplot2.png){fig-align="center"}

## Box Plot, Five-number summary:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
1. Minimum: The smallest data point excluding outliers.
    
1. First Quartile (Q1): The median of the lower half of the dataset.
    
1. Median (Q2): The middle value of the dataset.
    
1. Third Quartile (Q3): The median of the upper half of the dataset.
    
1. Maximum: The largest data point excluding outliers.

## Practice Box Plots {background-color="skyblue"}

- Basic Box Plot:	Summarizing distribution of a single variable.

- Box Plot by Category:	Comparing distributions across categories.

- With Outliers Highlighted:	Identifying potential outliers.

- Horizontal Box Plot:	Improving readability for long category names.

- Grouped Box Plot:	Comparing multiple groups within categories.

- Violin and Box Plot Combination:	Adding detailed distribution insights to a box plot.

- Customized Box Plot:	Enhancing visual appeal for reports or presentations.
  
## Heatmap

## Heatmap

- Purpose: Represent data in a matrix format using color coding.
    
- When to Use:
  - Visualize large datasets (e.g., correlations, gene expression).
  - Highlight patterns, hotspots and clusters.
  
## Practice Heat Maps Plots {background-color="skyblue"}

- Basic Heat Map	Visualizing relationships between categories and values.

- Heat Map with Labels	Adding specific values for easier interpretation.

- Correlation Heat Map	Visualizing pairwise correlations between variables.

- Time-Series Heat Map	Tracking changes over time for multiple categories.

- Diverging Heat Map	Highlighting deviations from a baseline or midpoint.
