## Population

> "an **entire set** of entities is known as population"

. . .

-   A population can be quite diverse but can also be more specific.

-   Different types of scientists might focus on different populations.

## ðŸ¤“ **Tellme Moore:** ***Examples of "population"***

::: panel-tabset
### **1. Educational Research**

-   **Population:**
    All 12 class students in India.
-   **Example:**
    If a researcher wants to study the average marks of 12th class students in India, the population would include every 12th class student across the country who has taken the 12th exam.

### **2. Healthcare Studies**

-   **Population:**\
    All diabetic patients in a city.\
-   **Example:**\
    A researcher investigating the effectiveness of a new diabetes medication may define the population as all individuals in the city who have been diagnosed with diabetes.

### **3. Market Research**

-   **Population:**\
    All people who purchase smartphones.\
-   **Example:**\
    A smartphone company wants to know the preferences of its target market. The population might be defined as all individuals globally who have purchased a smartphone in the last year.

### **4. Environmental Studies**

-   **Population:**\
    All trees in a forest.\
-   **Example:**\
    An environmental scientist measuring the average height of trees in a forest would consider the population to include every tree in that specific forest.

### **5. Political Surveys**

-   **Population:**\
    Registered voters in a country.\
-   **Example:**\
    A political poll aiming to predict the outcome of an election would define its population as all registered voters eligible to participate in that election.

### **6. Customer Feedback**

-   **Population:**\
    All customers of a particular online store.\
-   **Example:**\
    If an e-commerce company wants to measure customer satisfaction, the population would include everyone who has made a purchase on their platform.

### **7. Wildlife Research**

-   **Population:**\
    All Bengal tigers in India.\
-   **Example:**\
    A conservationist studying the average territory size of Bengal tigers would define the population as all Bengal tigers living in India.

### **8. Manufacturing and Quality Control**

-   **Population:**\
    All light bulbs produced by a factory in a week.\
-   **Example:**\
    A factory manager measuring the defect rate in light bulb production would define the population as all light bulbs manufactured in a specific week.

## Hypothesis

> "you can use existing theory, to generate a hypothesis, which is a **proposed explanation** of the specific observation that interests you"

. . .

[Hypothesis = Proposed Explanation]{.card .r-fit-text}

## Prediction

> A specific outcome you expect to observe if the hypothesis is correct.

## Variables

> "Elements in the study that are measured or manipulated."

-   Independent variable

-   Dependent variable

-   Control variable

## ðŸ¤“ **Tellme Moore:** ***Academic Performance and Sleep***

**How They Work Together:**

1.  **Theory** provides the foundation: Sleep impacts cognitive function.

2.  **Hypothesis** makes the relationship specific: More sleep leads to better exam scores.

3.  **Prediction** forecasts the result in measurable terms: Students with more sleep score 10% higher.

4.  **Variables** define the structure of the study: Sleep hours (IV), Exam scores (DV), and controlled factors (like study environment).

## Sample

> "you want to draw conclusions about the entire population, but it is **impractical** to collect data from every entity in the popultion."

. . .

> "so instead we use a sample which is **representative** of the wider population"

## Sample

## ðŸ¤“ **Tellme Moore:** ***Customer Satisfaction at "Coffee Bliss"***

**Objective:** The company wants to measure customer satisfaction with their service across all branches.

::: panel-tabset
#### **1. Population**

**Definition:** The entire group that is the focus of the study.

**Example:**\
All customers who visit **Coffee Bliss** branches worldwide in a given month.\
- This includes millions of customers from different locations, ages, and preferences.

#### **2. Sample**

**Definition:** A subset of the population selected for the study.

**Example:**\
The company randomly selects **1,000 customers** across various branches to participate in a survey.\
- The sample is smaller than the population but is expected to reflect the larger group.

#### **3. Representative Sample**

**Definition:** A sample that accurately reflects the characteristics of the population.

**Example:**\
To ensure the **1,000 customers** represent the population, the company ensures the sample includes:\
- Customers from **urban, suburban, and rural branches**.\
- A mix of **regular and first-time customers**.\
- A diversity of **ages, genders, and income levels**.

If the sample has only customers from urban branches or frequent visitors, it may not represent the entire population accurately, leading to biased results.

#### **Why It Matters:**

-   **Population:** Represents the "big picture" (all customers).\
-   **Sample:** Makes data collection feasible (1,000 customers).\
-   **Representative Sample:** Ensures findings can be generalized to the whole population (diverse group reflecting all customers).
