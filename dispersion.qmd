## Dispersion

<br>

> How spread out the data is around its mean.


## Measures of Dispersion

- **Range:** The difference between the maximum and minimum values.

- **Variance:** The average of the squared differences from the mean.

- **Standard Deviation (SD):** The square root of variance, representing average deviation from the mean.

- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The difference between the 75th percentile (Q3) and 25th percentile (Q1).

## Total Error/Deviance/Residual

> Add up the deviances for each data point

. . .

$$
total\;error = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n (outcome_{i} - model_i)
$$

. . .

$$
total\;deviance = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i} - \bar X)
$$

## Sum of Errors

$$
Sum \; of \;errors = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n (outcome_{i} - model_i)
$$

. . .

$$
= (28-30) + (29-30) + (29-30) + (30-30) \\+ (30-30) + (30-30) + (31-30) + (31-30) + \\(32-30)\\
= -2 + (-1) + (-1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 +2 \\
= 0
$$

## Sum of Squared Errors

$$
Sum \; of \; squared \;errors (SS) = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n (outcome_{i} - model_i)^2
$$

. . .

$$
Sum \; of \; squared \;errors (SS) = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i} - \bar{X})^2
$$

## Sum of Squared Errors ($SS$)

- ❌ Size of $SS$ depend on how many scores we have in the data.

- ❌  It is nuisance if we want to compare the total error across samples of different size.

- ✅  An easy solution is to divide $SS$ by the number of scores/observations ($N$).


## Variance

$$
mean \; squared \;error = \frac{SS}{N} = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n (outcome_{i} - model_i)^2}{N}
$$

. . .

$$
variance (\sigma^2) = \frac{SS}{N} = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n (outcome_{i} - model_i)^2}{N}
$$

- The symbol of variance in sample is $s^2$.

- The symbol of variance in population is $\sigma^2$.

## RAS Variance

The average error of the mean was 1.33 RAS units squared

$$
variance (\sigma^2) = \frac{SS}{N} = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n (outcome_{i} - model_i)^2}{N} \\ = \frac{12}{9} \\ = 1.33 
$$

## Standard Deviation

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{variance} = \sqrt\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n (outcome_{i} - model_i)^2}{N} \\ = \sqrt\frac{12}{9} \\ = \sqrt{1.33 } \\= 1.15
$$

## Degrees of Freedom

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{variance} = \sqrt\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n (outcome_{i} - model_i)^2}{N - 1} \\ = \sqrt\frac{12}{8} \\ = \sqrt{1.5} \\= 1.22
$$

## Outliers and Variance

- The variance with the outlier is 37.43

- The variance without the outlier is 1.5

## Standard Deviation and Dispersion

- A small standard deviation (relative to the value of the mean) indicates that data points are close to the mean.

- A large standard deviation (relative to the mean) indicates that the data points are distant from the mean.

- A standard deviation of 0 would mean that all of the scores were the same.
