## Frequency Distribution

> "Frequency distribution can either be a **table** or a **graph** that shows each possible score along with the number of times that score occurred in the data."

## Frequency Distribution 

- **Frequency:** how many times each score occurs.

- If you add up the frequencies ($\sum f$) you get the sample size ($N$).

- We should mention the category even if the freqency is zero.

## 🤔 How does this help me to understand whether women are attracted to guys with high salaries?

> **Relative Frequency:** How often a response is observed relative to the total number of responses.

## Relative Frequency

$$
relative\;frequency = \frac{frequency\;of\;response}{total\;number\;of\;responses}\\ = \frac{f}{N}
$$

## Relative Frequency of Rating 10

$$
relative\;frequency = \frac{frequency\;of\;rating\;10}{total\;number\;of\;responses}\\ = \frac{2}{20}\\=0.1
$$

> 10% of women rated a high salary's importance at 10 out of 10.
