# Do women tend to prefer ❤️ dating men with higher salaries? {background-color="seagreen"}

## Frequency Distribution

<br>

> "Frequency distribution can either be a **table** or a **graph** that shows each possible score along with the number of times that score occurred in the data."

## Frequency Distribution 

- **Frequency:** how many times each score occurs.

- If you add up the frequencies ($\sum f$) you get the sample size ($N$).

- We should mention the category even if the freqency is zero.

. . .

## 🤔 How does this help me to understand whether women are attracted to guys with high salaries?

<br>

. . .

> **Relative Frequency:** How often a response is observed relative to the total number of responses.

## Relative Frequency

$$
relative\;frequency = \frac{frequency\;of\;response}{total\;number\;of\;responses}\\ = \frac{f}{N}
$$

## Relative Frequency of Rating 10

$$
relative\;frequency = \frac{frequency\;of\;rating\;10}{total\;number\;of\;responses}\\ = \frac{2}{20}\\=0.1
$$

. . .

> 10% of women rated a high salary's importance at 10 out of 10.

## 🤯 Your Turn {background-color="seagreen"}

Calculate Relative Frequency for score 4 on High Salary.

## Graphical Frequency Distributions: Frequency Polygon

## Practice {background-color="skyblue"}

- Frequency table

- Relative frequency table

- Visualizing Relative Frequencies

## Grouped Frequency

> "a frequency distribution where we group scores together"

. . .

![](images/group-freq.png){fig-align="center"}

## Grouped Frequency Distribution

$$
interval\;width = \frac{range\;of\;scores}{number\;of\;intervals}
$$

. . .

$$
= \frac{highest\;score - lowest\;score}{number\;of\;intervals}
$$

## Relationship Assessment Score

The RAS score of 20 similar age group women are:

<br>

16, 23, 26, 22, 14, 20, 8, 19, 22, 25, <br>17, 26, 27, 11, 32, 17, 20, 17, 14, 28.

[95% of them rated their relationship satisfaction lower than Alisha (32).]{.r-fit-text}
