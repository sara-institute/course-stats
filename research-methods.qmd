## Statistics

> **Definition:** A numerical summary of a sample.

<br>

. . .

> **Scope:** Describes the characteristics of a subset (sample).

<br>

. . .

> **Purpose:** Used to estimate or infer the parameter.

## Parameters

> **Definition:** A numerical summary of a population.

<br>

. . .

> **Scope:** Describes the characteristics of the entire group (population).

<br>

. . .

> **Purpose:** Represents the true value for the population.

## ü§ì **Tellme Moore:** ***Average Test Scores of 500 Students***

**Key Differences**

1.  **Parameter** is about the population (e.g., the average score of all 500 students).

2.  **Statistic** is about a sample (e.g., the average score of 50 students).

3.  **Goal:** A statistic is used to [estimate]{.clr-tom} the parameter.

## Sampling Variation

> "These statistics vary from one sample to the next."

## Sampling Error

> "These statistics sometimes differ from the population parameter."

## üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Practice Statistics vs. Parameters {background-color="skyblue"}

Imagine we have a population of students' heights, and we take a sample from this population to calculate statistics and compare them to the parameters.

## Descriptive Statistics

> Summarizes and organizes data to describe its main features.

<br>

. . .

> Limited to the observed data.

## Inferential Statistics

> Makes predictions or inferences about a population from a sample.

<br>

. . .

> Goes beyond the observed data to infer population characteristics.

## üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Practice Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics {background-color="skyblue"}

We will practice both descriptive and inferential statistics using a dataset of students' test scores.

# Research Methods

## Research Methods

We can test a hypothesis in one of two ways:

## ü§ì **Tellme Moore:** ***Exercise and Academic Performance:***

::: panel-tabset
### Correlational Method

**Purpose:** To identify if a relationship exists between two variables but without establishing causation.

You collect data on two variables:

1.  Exercise: The number of hours students exercise per week.

2.  Academic Performance: Students' GPA (Grade Point Average).

You analyze the data to see if there‚Äôs a correlation (e.g., higher exercise hours are associated with higher GPAs).

**Outcome:** "Exercise is positively correlated with GPA."

### Experimental Method

**Purpose:** To determine causation by manipulating one variable and controlling others.

You design an experiment where you divide students into two groups:

1.  Experimental Group: Students are asked to exercise 3 times a week for 1 hour.

2.  Control Group: Students are not required to change their exercise habits.

Measure their GPAs over a semester.

**Outcome:** "Exercise improves GPA."

Let‚Äôs estimate the average height of a population using a sample. We‚Äôll calculate both a point estimate and a confidence interval (interval estimate) for the mean.
