## Variable

<br>

> A variable is a characteristic or attribute that can take on different values.

## Independent Variables

> The variable that is manipulated or controlled by the researcher to observe its effect on another variable.

- Predictor

## Dependent Variables

> The variable that is measured or observed to assess the impact of the independent variable.

- Effect or output or outcome.
    
## Examples

Example 1: Education Study

  - Independent Variable: Teaching method (traditional vs. interactive).
  - Dependent Variable: Student performance on a test.

Example 2: Health Study

  - Independent Variable: Amount of daily exercise (30 mins, 60 mins, 90 mins).
  - Dependent Variable: Weight loss (in kilograms).

Example 3: Marketing Study

  - Independent Variable: Type of advertisement (video, banner, text).
  - Dependent Variable: Number of clicks or purchases.

## Practice {background-color="skyblue"}

Weâ€™ll simulate data to demonstrate the relationship between independent and dependent variables.

1. Example: Hours of Study and Test Scores

1. Inverse Relationship Example

1. No-Relation Example

## Hypothesis

> A hypothesis is a **testable statement or prediction** about the relationship between two or more variables.

## Types of Hypotheses

-   **Null Hypothesis** ($H_0$): The null hypothesis states that there is **no effect, no difference**, or **no relationship** between the variables being studied. It assumes that any observed differences are due to chance.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis** ($H_a$ or $H_1$): The alternative hypothesis suggests that there is **an effect** or **relationship** between the variables. It is the hypothesis that is supported if the null hypothesis is rejected.

## Formulate Hypotheses

ðŸ“š **Education Scenario:** Investigating whether a new teaching method improves student test scores compared to the traditional method.

::: panel-tabset
### Non-Directional

-   **Null Hypothesis** ($H_0$):: The new teaching method has no effect on student test scores.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis** ($H_a$ or $H_1$): The new teaching method affects student test scores.

### Directional

-   **Null Hypothesis** ($H_0$):: The new teaching method does not improve student test scores.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis** ($H_a$ or $H_1$): The new teaching method improves student test scores.

## Key Points

-   **Non-Directional Hypotheses** are used when you are testing for any effect, regardless of the direction (e.g., an increase or decrease).

-   **Directional Hypotheses** are used when you have a specific prediction about the direction of the effect (e.g., an improvement or reduction).

**ðŸ’‰ Medicine Scenario:** Evaluating whether Drug A lowers blood pressure more effectively than a placebo.

### Non-Directional

-   **Null Hypothesis** ($H_0$): Drug A has no effect on blood pressure compared to the placebo.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis** ($H_a$ or $H_1$): Drug A affects blood pressure compared to the placebo.

### Directional

-   **Null Hypothesis** ($H_0$): Drug A does not lower blood pressure more effectively than the placebo.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis** ($H_a$ or $H_1$): Drug A lowers blood pressure more effectively than the placebo.

## Formulate Hypotheses

**ðŸŒ± Environment Scenario:** Determining whether an areaâ€™s air quality index (AQI) changes after implementing stricter pollution regulations.

. . .

::: panel-tabset
### Non-Directional

-   **Null Hypothesis** ($H_0$): Stricter pollution regulations have no effect on the AQI.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis** ($H_a$ or $H_1$): Stricter pollution regulations affect the AQI.

### Directional

-   **Null Hypothesis** ($H_0$): Stricter pollution regulations do not improve the AQI.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis** ($H_a$ or $H_1$): Stricter pollution regulations improve the AQI.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis** ($H_a$ or $H_1$): The fertilizer affects plant growth.

### Directional

-   **Null Hypothesis** ($H_0$): The fertilizer does not increase plant growth.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis** ($H_a$ or $H_1$): The fertilizer increases plant growth.

### Directional

-   **Null Hypothesis** ($H_0$): The app does not decrease the average time users spend on their phones.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis** ($H_a$ or $H_1$): The app decreases the average time users spend on their phones.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis** ($H_a$ or $H_1$): Increasing the minimum wage affects unemployment rates.

### Directional

-   **Null Hypothesis** ($H_0$): Increasing the minimum wage does not increase unemployment rates.

## Key Differences

<br>

::: r-fit-text
| Aspect | Directional Hypothesis | Non-Directional Hypothesis |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Prediction** | Specifies the direction of the effect (e.g., increase, decrease). | Predicts an effect but no specific direction. |
| **Test Type** | One-tailed test | Two-tailed test |
| **Use Case** | When prior research or theory suggests a specific outcome. | When unsure of the outcome's direction. |
| **Hypothesis Example** | $H_a$: Group A scores are higher than Group B scores. | $H_a$: Group A scores are different from Group B scores. |
| **Null Hypothesis** ($H_0$) | No effect in the predicted direction. | No effect or difference. |
